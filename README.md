# TRASH ACADEMY

STEAM(Science Technology Engineering Art Math) education curriculum centered around building self-replicating technology from trash which satisfies all human needs.

The initial curriculum centers around making things with Ardiuno(trash robot), and making self-replicating web documents(geometron).  We teach students how to make things using both digital and physical media which people want and to then sell and barter what they create to support themselves directly.

Trash Academy is a place where people learn to make things, then make them, and then trade them. Each lesson is built around one of the things we can make as products that customers want.

The teaching will take place in a [TRASHSPACE](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashspace), which is just a community space with room to work on art, technology and crafts and free food.
